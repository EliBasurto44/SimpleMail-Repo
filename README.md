# SimpleMail-Repo
This is my project SimpleMail, which is an AI powered email client for senior citizens. For privacy reasons my email/login have been removed from the code, along with my API key. I used OpenRouter AI models (currently Mistral Devstral Free) for the AI agent and gradio for the user interface

!!!!WILL NOT WORK FOR YOU IN CURRENT STATE -   IN ORDER TO USE COPY CODE INTO CODING APP OF CHOICE AND GENERATE YOUR OWN API IN OPENROUTER AND USE YOUR OWN EMAIL LOGIN!!!!!!
